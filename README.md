Zip_Cracker

Used python-3 standard library to crack zip file. 
The idea is to use brute force try each password in you dictionary.
Use mult-threading for different password dictionary.

How to use:
This is only a test code, so I didn't write GUI for it.
Find the code at the bottomï¼š(Line 66 and 67)
dic = ['pwd_dic_1,txt', 'pwd_dic_2,txt', ......]
target_file = 'zipfile_path'

Input the path of password dictionary and the target zip file.
Run ZipCracker.py.
